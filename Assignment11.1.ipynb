    "Ans. Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are fundamental concepts in probability and statistics used to describe the probability distribution of random variables. They differ in their application to discrete and continuous random variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It assigns probabilities to specific values of the random variable. The sum of all these probabilities is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a PMF:\n",
    "Consider a random variable X representing the number of heads when tossing a fair coin twice. The PMF for X is as follows:\n",
    "- P(X = 0) = 1/4\n",
    "- P(X = 1) = 1/2\n",
    "- P(X = 2) = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, X can only take on discrete values (0, 1, or 2), and the PMF specifies the probability of each value occurring. For instance, P(X = 1) is the probability of getting one head in two coin tosses, which is 1/2.\n",

    "(2) Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF) is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike discrete random variables, continuous random variables can take on an infinite number of values within a given range. The PDF provides the relative likelihood of the variable falling within a specific interval, and the probability is calculated by finding the area under the PDF curve over that interval.\n",

    "f(y) = λ * e^(-λy) for y ≥ 0\n",
    "\n",
    "In this PDF, λ is the rate parameter of the exponential distribution. The PDF describes the probability density of Y taking on different values. To find the probability that the bulb burns out between times a and b, you would calculate the integral of the PDF from a to b, which is the area under the curve over that interval."

    "Height of Individuals: The distribution of human heights is often modeled by a normal distribution. The mean and standard deviation of this distribution can provide insights into the average height and the range of heights in a population.\n",
    "\n",

    "(c) Financial Markets: Daily or monthly returns on financial assets, such as stocks or currencies, are often modeled as normally distributed. This assumption forms the basis of many financial models, like the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Biological Phenomena: Various biological traits, such as birth weights, blood pressure, and enzyme activity levels, can often be approximated by a normal distribution. This is particularly useful for understanding the variability in these traits in a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Manufacturing and Quality Control: When measuring the quality of manufactured products, such as the diameter of bolts or the weight of cereal boxes, the normal distribution is often used to model the variability, with the mean representing the target value and the standard deviation indicating the level of acceptable variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of the normal distribution:\n",
    "(1) Mean (μ): The mean, or average, represents the central tendency of the distribution. It is the value around which the data is centered. Shifting the mean to the left or right on the number line will result in a corresponding shift in the entire distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data. A small standard deviation indicates that data points are clustered closely around the mean, resulting in a tall and narrow bell curve. A large standard deviation indicates that data points are more spread out, resulting in a shorter and wider bell curve.\n",

    "The shape of the normal distribution is determined by these parameters:\n",

    "Ans. The Bernoulli distribution is a simple and fundamental discrete probability distribution that models a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) and failure (usually denoted as 0). It is named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli. The Bernoulli distribution is often used to model situations where there are only two possible outcomes, and it's a building block for more complex distributions like the binomial distribution.\n",

    "X = 1 if it's heads (success).\n",
    "X = 0 if it's tails (failure).\n",
    "In this case, p (the probability of success, i.e., getting heads) is 0.5, and 1 - p is also 0.5 (the probability of failure, i.e., getting tails).\n",

    "Bernoulli Distribution: Has a single parameter p, representing the probability of success in a single trial.\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Has two parameters: n (the number of trials) and p (the probability of success in each trial).\n",

    "Ans. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that states that the distribution of the sample means (or sums) of a large enough number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the individual variables. In other words, it asserts that as you collect more samples and calculate their means, the sampling distribution of those means will become increasingly close to a normal distribution.\n",

    "(b) Inference and Hypothesis Testing: The CLT is the foundation for many statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. It allows us to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.\n",

    "(c) Real-World Applications: It is applicable to a wide range of practical situations where data is collected, from quality control in manufacturing to opinion polling in political science. It's particularly valuable when the sample size is sufficiently large, as it helps us make accurate estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Reliability: The CLT helps ensure that estimates made from samples are more likely to be accurate. It's why we can make statements like, \"We are 95% confident that the true population mean falls within this interval.\"\n",

    "Ans. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that plays a crucial role in making statistical inferences about populations. It states that, under certain conditions, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. These assumptions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Random Sampling: Samples must be drawn randomly from the population of interest. This means that every member of the population has an equal and independent chance of being included in the sample. Random sampling ensures that the sample is representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Independence: Individual observations within each sample must be independent of one another. This means that the value of one observation should not be influenced by or related to the value of another observation. Independence is crucial because it prevents systematic biases in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Finite Variance: The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite variance. In practical terms, this assumption implies that the population distribution should not be excessively skewed or have heavy tails. A finite variance ensures that the population's variability is bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Sufficiently Large Sample Size: While there is no strict threshold for what constitutes a \"sufficiently large\" sample, a common guideline is that a sample size of 30 or more is often considered adequate. However, in some situations, smaller sample sizes can also yield approximately normal sampling distributions, especially if the population distribution is nearly normal."
