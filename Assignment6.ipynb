    "Ans. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient data retrieval, management, and manipulation. Databases are used to store, manage, and access a wide variety of information, from simple lists to complex and interconnected data used in applications, websites, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main categories of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "1 Data Model:\n",
    "   -SQL databases follow a structured and relational data model.\n",
    "   -Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas that define the structure of the data, including column names and data types.\n",
    "   -Tables can be related to each other using primary keys and foreign keys, allowing for complex data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Query Language:\n",
    "   -SQL databases use the SQL query language for data manipulation.\n",
    "   -SQL provides powerful querying capabilities, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, as well as JOIN operations for combining data from multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 ACID Compliance:\n",
    "   -SQL databases are typically ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, which ensures data integrity and reliability, making them suitable for applications that require strict data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Use Cases:\n",
    "   -SQL databases are a good fit for applications where data relationships are well-defined and unlikely to change frequently.\n",
    "   -They are commonly used in traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1 Data Model:\n",
    "   -NoSQL databases support various data models, including document, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.\n",
    "   -Data is stored in a more flexible, semi-structured, or unstructured format.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2 Query Language:\n",
    "   -NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs depending on the type of database.\n",
    "   -Some NoSQL databases provide query languages, while others use simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 ACID Compliance:\n",
    "   -NoSQL databases may sacrifice full ACID compliance in favor of performance, scalability, and flexibility. Some provide eventual consistency instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Use Cases:\n",
    "   -NoSQL databases are suitable for applications that require high scalability and can handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "   -They are often used in web applications, real-time analytics, content management systems, and big data applications.\n",
    "   -Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column-family), and Neo4j (graph)."

    "Ans. Primary Key and Foreign Key are two important concepts in relational database management systems (RDBMS). They are used to define and maintain relationships between tables in a database. \n",

    "A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row or record in that table. It enforces data integrity by ensuring that each row has a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a Primary Key:\n",
    "Each value in the Primary Key column(s) must be unique within the table.\n",
    "A Primary Key column cannot contain NULL values, ensuring that every row has a valid identifier.\n",
    "The values in a Primary Key column should generally not change over time.\n",
    "Example: Consider an \"Employees\" table with an \"EmployeeID\" column as the Primary Key. Each employee would have a unique \"EmployeeID.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in one table that establishes a link or relationship between the data in two tables. It typically refers to the Primary Key of another table, thereby creating a relational connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a Foreign Key:\n",
    "It ensures that data in the Foreign Key column(s) of one table corresponds to the values in the Primary Key column(s) of another table.\n",
    "Foreign Keys are used to define and maintain relationships between tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.\n",

    "3 GROUP BY Clause:\n",
    "   -The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows from the result set into groups based on the values of one or more columns. It is often used with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., to perform calculations on each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 HAVING Clause:\n",
    "   -The HAVING clause is used to filter the groups created by the GROUP BY clause based on a condition. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on groups rather than individual rows.\n",

    "6 DISTINCT Keyword:\n",
    "   -If the DISTINCT keyword is used, duplicate rows are eliminated from the result set at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 ORDER BY Clause:\n",
    "   -The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. It determines the order in which the rows are presented in the final output.\n",
