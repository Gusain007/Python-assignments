    "Ans. Central tendency refers to measures like the mean, median, and mode, which describe the center or typical value of a data set. Dispersion measures, on the other hand, include measures like the range, variance, and standard deviation, which describe the spread or variability of the data. Outliers can distort these measures in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "a. Mean: Outliers, especially extreme ones, can pull the mean in their direction. For example, if you have a dataset of salaries in a small company, and one executive earns an exceptionally high salary, that outlier will inflate the mean salary for the entire company, making it appear higher than what most employees earn.\n",
    "\n",

    "c. Mode: Outliers do not affect the mode, as it represents the most frequently occurring value in the data, and it is not sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "a. Range: Outliers can have a significant impact on the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. If there is an outlier at one extreme end of the data, the range will be much larger than it would be without the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation, as these measures are based on the squared differences between data points and the mean. When squared, the differences are magnified, and extreme values have a substantial influence on these measures.\n",
