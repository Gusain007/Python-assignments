    "Ans. In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors that can occur: Type I error and Type II error. These errors are associated with the decisions made when testing a null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I Error (False Positive):\n",
    "A Type I error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually true is rejected. In other words, it's a false positive, where you mistakenly conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when there isn't.\n",
    "Symbol: Denoted as α (alpha).\n",
    "Example Scenario: Imagine a pharmaceutical company testing a new drug for a particular disease. The null hypothesis (H0) states that the drug has no effect, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) suggests that the drug is effective. If the company erroneously rejects the null hypothesis (H0) and concludes that the drug is effective (when, in reality, it's not), it results in a Type I error. This can be harmful because the drug might be released to the market even though it doesn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type II Error (False Negative):\n",
    "A Type II error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually false is not rejected. In other words, it's a false negative, where you fail to detect a significant effect or difference when it actually exists.\n",
    "Symbol: Denoted as β (beta).\n",
    "Example Scenario: Let's continue with the pharmaceutical example. This time, assume the drug is genuinely effective (i.e., the null hypothesis is false), but the company fails to reject the null hypothesis (H0). This results in a Type II error. Patients do not benefit from the effective drug because it's not approved for use.\n",
    "The concept of Type I and Type II errors is often framed in the context of a trade-off. In hypothesis testing, you can control the probability of making one type of error (e.g., reducing the chance of a Type I error) at the expense of increasing the probability of making the other type of error (e.g., a Type II error). This trade-off is controlled by the significance level (α), which is often set at a predetermined value (e.g., 0.05) to determine the risk of a Type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Type I error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis, while Type II error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. Understanding and minimizing these errors are essential in statistical hypothesis testing, as they have practical implications in various fields, such as medicine, manufacturing, and scientific research."

    "Ans. Bayes's theorem, named after the 18th-century statistician and philosopher Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes how to update our beliefs about an event or hypothesis in light of new evidence. Bayes's theorem relates conditional probabilities, which are probabilities that are dependent on some prior knowledge or evidence.\n",

    "Medical Testing Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is a medical test to detect a rare disease, and the test is not perfect. It has a known false positive rate of 5%, meaning that 5% of healthy individuals who take the test will receive a positive result. The test also has a false negative rate of 10%, meaning that 10% of individuals with the disease will receive a negative result. The prevalence of the disease in the population is 2%, meaning that 2% of people actually have the disease.\n",

    "Define the events:\n",

    "Event A: The individual has the disease.\n",
    "Event B: The individual tests positive.\n",
    "Determine the probabilities:\n",
    "P(A): The prior probability of an individual having the disease is 2% or 0.02.\n",
    "P(B|A): The probability of testing positive given that the individual has the disease is 90% (1 - 0.10, which accounts for the false negative rate).\n",
    "P(B|-A): The probability of testing positive given that the individual does not have the disease is 5% (the false positive rate).\n",
    "P(-A): The probability of an individual not having the disease is 98% (1 - 0.02).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "Now we can use Bayes's theorem to calculate the probability that an individual who tests positive actually has the disease:\n",

    "Where P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n",
    "P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|-A) * P(-A)\n",
    "P(B) = (0.90 * 0.02) + (0.05 * 0.98) = 0.018 + 0.049 = 0.067\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = (0.90 * 0.02)/0.067 = 0.2687\n",

    "Ans. A confidence interval is a range of values that is constructed around a sample statistic (e.g., a sample mean) to estimate an unknown population parameter (e.g., the population mean) with a certain level of confidence. It provides a range within which the true parameter is likely to fall. In other words, it quantifies the uncertainty or variability associated with estimating population parameters from sample data.\n",

    "Point Estimate ± Margin of Error\n",

    "The \"point estimate\" is the sample statistic used to estimate the population parameter, such as the sample mean.\n",
    "The \"margin of error\" is a measure of the range of values that are likely to contain the true population parameter. It depends on the level of confidence and the variability in the data.\n",

For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is approximately 1.96 (assuming a large sample size, which allows us to use the Z-distribution). If your sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown, you would use a T-score instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Calculate the Margin of Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is determined by the formula:\n",

    "Margin of Error = 1.96 × (5/√100) = 1.96 × 5/10 = 0.98 centimeters\n",

    "(5) Interpret the Confidence Interval: The 95% confidence interval for the average height of adult males in the city is 174.02 cm to 175.98 cm. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean height falls within this range."

    "A Z-score of 1 indicates that the data point (75) is 1 standard deviation above the mean (70) in the population. This means the data point is relatively higher compared to the average value, and it is located in the upper 84th percentile of the population. In a standard normal distribution (with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1), a Z-score of 1 corresponds to the 84th percentile, meaning that 84% of the data falls below this value."
