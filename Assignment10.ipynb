    "Ans. Statistics is a branch of mathematics and a scientific method that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides a framework for understanding and summarizing complex information to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions. Statistics encompasses various techniques, such as data collection, probability theory, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. It plays a crucial role in diverse fields, including science, business, economics, and social sciences, by helping to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within data. In essence, statistics is a powerful tool for quantifying uncertainty, making predictions, and extracting valuable insights from data to inform decision-making and drive research and policy."

    "Ans.Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics - It is used to summarize and present data in a clear and concise manner. It provide a snapshot of the essential characteristics of a dataset without making predictions. Common measures in descriptive statistics include central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), frequency distributions, and percentiles. For example, you might calculate the average income in a region, create a histogram of test scores in a classroom, or determine the 75th percentile age in a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics - It involves making predictions, drawing conclusions, and testing hypotheses based on a sample of data. This type of statistics allows researchers to make inferences about a larger population from a smaller sample. Common techniques include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). For instance, you might use inferential statistics to test if a new drug is more effective, estimate the average height of a population, determine how variables affect salary, or compare the performance of marketing strategies."

    "Ans. Understanding the level of measurement is crucial for accurate data analysis. It determines the types of statistical tests and operations that can be applied, ensuring meaningful and valid results. For instance, using arithmetic means for ordinal data may lead to incorrect conclusions, as the order may not reflect proportional differences. In a medical study, if pain levels (ordinal) are mistakenly averaged, it can misrepresent treatment effectiveness. In contrast, understanding that height (ratio) allows for valid averaging and meaningful comparisons ensures that conclusions are reliable and appropriate for the data's nature, ultimately supporting informed decision-making in various fields, from healthcare to economics."
